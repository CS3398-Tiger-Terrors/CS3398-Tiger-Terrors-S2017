# Pool Boy App
â€“ an Android Pool Expense Management System with Calculator

# Description:

This application allows users to maintain a digital automated inventory - a swimming pool volume calculator, chemical dosage calculator, and data logger. This could also be expanded to include a small-scale inventory tracker and when combined with their expenses for these products, calculate the cost per treatment/week/month of their pool maintenance. For safety and security, the calculations can easily follow the recommended dosing levels by IPSSA, an international pool/spa service association.

The app is a pocket pool boy. A first-time user of the app will be able to create a "profile" for their pool that includes how many gallons of water is in the pool (volume). This can later be expanded to include information about the equipment and possibly store pictures of it (to aid in ordering replacement parts down the road). The main part of the app allows a user to input what their pool levels currently are (the PPM of chlorine, the pH, the alkalinity, calcium level, etc) and using their current levels, calculate how much of different chemicals are needed for a pool of their size to balance the chemistry to the proper industry standard levels.

If possible, we can set up the app to track the history of the inputted values, and track what chemicals are added. This can also be expanded to keep track of expenses by allowing a user to input their cost for various chemicals. i.e., if they pay $100 for a 50lb bucket of chlorine and $4 for a gallon of muriatic acid, and on a balancing of the pool they need 2lbs of chlorine and 1/4 gallon of acid, we can keep track of "Hey! this week your pool cost $3 in chemicals!" Also, by keeping track of how much of each chemical they buy, we can keep inventory on what they have on hand by keeping track of what is being put in the pool.

For getting the volume of the pool, there are VERY simple calculations that we can ask for basic length, width, and average depth of the pool and calculate the volume for the users.
